# Memory-Management-on-Linux-Homework-
n this assignment, you’ll implement a custom version of malloc, free, and realloc. You should implement these in mymalloc.c and mymalloc.h. These files should not contain a main function, so you may want a separate .c file for testing. You’ll also write a performance testing program in memperf.c
